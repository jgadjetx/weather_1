Weather One

This is a Flutter Weather App primarily developed to showcase my technical knowledge 
as well as practices I believe are the best. 

The weather data is coming from the OpenWeatherMap API (https://rapidapi.com/community/api/open-weather-map).

I have decided to use the MVVM design pattern to separate my programming logic as well as 
Provider as a means of State-Management.

Any questions, feedback or criticism would be highly appreciated!
